# Automating-BackUp-From-MySQL-To-PURE-FTPD-Server
# About the Project -

This project implements a full automation of generating a timestamped backup of a specified MySQL database, compressing it into a ZIP file, and storing it locally. The compressed backup is then uploaded to an FTP server using provided credentials. Additionally, it deletes local backup files older than 10 days, ensuring efficient storage management.
